# Astro MÂ²DX - Common

> **DEPRECATED:** Please consider using the plugin [astro-m2dx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/astro-m2dx), which bundles all features from the different `@astro-m2dx` plugins in one plugin (all features are opt-in).

This package just provides a few helpers to work with Vite, the filesystem, remark and rehype, that are common to all plugins.

It is not meant to be used stand-alone, but if you feel it fit for your purpose... Go ahead, astronaut and use it for whatever you like.
