# Astro MÂ²DX - Remark plugin for common frontmatter

> **DEPRECATED:** Please consider using the plugin [astro-m2dx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/astro-m2dx), which bundles all features from the different `@astro-m2dx` plugins in one plugin (all features are opt-in).

remark plugin to define common frontmatter for all Markdown files in a directory, e.g. to set a common layout for all files.

[Astro MÂ²DX](https://astro-m2dx.netlify.app) is a set of plugins allowing you to define an [Astro](https://astro.build) ðŸš€ publishing pipeline for Markdown/MDX documents with full [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) features, but without the technical fuss, i.e. you and your non-tech editors can write **clean** markdown.

Have a look at the other [`astro-m2dx` plugins](https://www.npmjs.com/org/astro-m2dx).

## What is this?

This package is a [`remark`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/blob/main/doc/plugins.md) plugin for markdown files in the context of [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx) site generation, that allows you to define common frontmatter for all markdown files in a directory and it's subdirectories.

## When should I use this?

If you want to extract common frontmatter properties for all files in a directory, e.g. the `layout` to a common file within the directory (`_frontmatter.yaml` by default). This helps you, keep your markdown files and their frontmatter as clean as possible.

## Install

This package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c).
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with `npm`:

```sh
npm install -D @astro-m2dx/remark-astro-frontmatter
```

## Use

In your `astro.config.mjs`

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

import mdx from '@astrojs/mdx';
import frontmatter from '@astro-m2dx/remark-astro-frontmatter';
// ^^^

// https://astro.build/config
export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [mdx()],
  markdown: {
    remarkPlugins: [frontmatter],
    //              ^^^
    extendDefaultPlugins: true,
  },
});
```

This uses the default options, where the name of the frontmatter files is `_frontmatter.yaml`.

Now you can create frontmatter files in your `src` directory to define common properties. The properties will be deeply merged, where properties from markdown file's frontmatter will have highest priority, and properties from frontmatter files closer to the markdown file will take precedence over properties from files higher up the tree.

### Options

If you want to use a different name for the frontmatter files, you can specify it in the plugin's `name` option like so:

```js
    remarkPlugins: [[frontmatter, {name: "_props.yaml"}]],
```
